### Step 4: 
Then print that values,it shows many values after decimal to avoid that we should give {:.2f}
### Step 5: 
After finishing that we should push this into the git repository by giving the command git push -u origin main.
### PROGRAM:

### OUTPUT:

### RESULT:
The output for Distance between the two points is Successfull.
